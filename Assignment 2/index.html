    <h1>The Presence of Little Women</h1>
    <h2>Leah Harvey</h2>

    <p><i>Little Women</i> is a series in two parts, written by Louisa May Alcott. Set in the 1800’s, the series follows four sisters as they navigate from adolescence to adulthood. The girls suffer through loss, the struggles of poverty, and finding a balance of seeking their own individuality while also navigating familial duties and the conventional roles women held at the time. Meg, the oldest, follows closest to the stereotypical “women’s role,” of finding a husband and settling down. Jo, an aspiring writer and tomboy, writes and works to earn her family a living. Beth, harboring a quietness and a love for music, is cut short as she is taken by illness. And Amy, the youngest, pursues her love for art and craves the rich life. Little Women is an interesting story because of its focuses. Each character feels important. As the girls grow up with their neighbour and good friend, Laurie, readers can’t help but become fascinated with their worlds and passions. Each characters feel real and individual as they face the challenges life has to offer.</p>

    <p>As such, the first visualization offers a closer look at just how important each of the four March sisters are. In the display, each of the four girls has been assigned to a light of a certain colour, casting across the shape. The overall brightness and intensity of the lights are representative of each woman’s presence in the story. The checked boxes will turn each light on and off, to further showcase the reach of each girl’s presence, and their absence when they are not included. To this end, it is clear that each girl has a significant presence in the story. While the reach of the green light – associated with Jo – just slightly overpowers compared to the rest, it is again, only slight. Overall, the lights all share a similar level of intensity. Also notable is how strong Beth’s presence remains in the story, as her light still remains equivalent to the others. Viewing each light individually showcases that Beth, who ends up passing away within the last quarter of the story, remains an important presence, maintaining a strength and individuality as her own character even as she does not see the book’s end.</p>

    <p>The second visualization showcases the intricacies of two important relationships in the series. Laurie, the boy who grew up with the March sisters, has a strong connection with both Jo and Amy over the course of the series. As such, the visualization of the data is set up in different ways. Each instance of the characters names is shown in proportion to their position of the story, leaving gaps as they are not present, and becoming denser as they appear within the story. The objects themselves are smaller and clustered together in order to highlight that density and to better showcase exactly where the characters appear in the story and who they interact with. As well, the objects are positioned side by side for ease of comparison. </p>

    <p>One notable moment occurs when there is a gap in both Laurie’s and Amy’s visualizations. From there, both visualizations begin to look very similar in density and location to one another, as the two character’s fall in love and get married. It is evident how, even though all three characters are still very present in the story, Amy and Laurie are most often seen together, while Jo is less present alongside Laurie. It can also be noted that around this time, Jo’s visualization experiences a significant gap, varying vastly from Laurie’s as she rejects his marriage proposal, heavily straining their relationship. Overall, the visualization takes those gaps and similarities to showcase how the relationships between the three characters dramatically change.</p>

    <p>To conlcude, one component I would have liked to include involved the method of display in the second visualization. The visualization was displayed using a component of multiple shapes being drawn and positioned to portray each term’s presence in the story. However. I would have liked to see each term represented as a ring, or torus, and have the mesh either fabricate or remain empty based on the word’s presence in the story. In that case, there would be clear gaps in the torus where the term was not present. Additionally, layering each of the rings together could have represented where one term may be present instead of another. In this case, I was unable to determine a method to effectively change the dimensions of a single mesh. In the future, I would aim to further customize my visualizations, either using colour or different shapes to tell a truly visual story that draws inspiration from the source text. While the visualizations I used were effective, I do wish they were more related to source text.</p>
